            <p class="section-text">The device which will host the OS has an ARM processor. Using a cross-compiling toolchain, it is possible to generate executables which will run on a different architecture than from which the compiler program was ran.</p>


            <h4 class="instruction">Terminology</h4>
            <p class="section-text">The system on which the compiler, linker, assembler and all the other toolchain programs run is called the <i>build</i> system. The system which will run the generated executables is called the <i>host</i> system.</p>


            <h4 class="instruction">File structure</h4>
            <p class="section-text">Create the directory structure shown below. Here, <i>/home/kvoid</i> is my home directory, so feel free to create the <i>output</i> directory elsewhere. I just placed it there for convenience.</p>
            <div class="code">home                    
└──kvoid <span># this is just my home directory</span>

            <h4 class="instruction">Docker</h4>
            <p class="section-text">I wont go into detail about building images and running containers. If something is not clear or hard to understand, I suggest reading the docker documentation.</p>
            <div class="code"><span># Dockerfile reference</span>

            <p class="section-text">Through testing I've determined that GCC 13.3 compiles the best performing programs for this specific device. I also found that musl libc performs marginally better than glibc. </p>
            <p class="section-text">With this in mind, I put together a docker image which contains the bare minimum thats required to run a toolchain. It is based on the testing branch of debian (currently trixie) and by default only contains the toolchain executables, host libraries and the base operating system.</p>
            <p class="section-text">Using said image as a base, a full toolchain image can be constructed that not only contains the toolchain executables, but other build tools such as GNU make, autoconf, perl and anything that might be needed for cross compilation. An example Dockerfile is attached below.</p>

            <p class="section-text">The examle dockerfile installs every tool that is needed to build the programs that i'll be running. If additional tools are required, append their name to the apt install command in the dockerfile.</p>


            <h4 class="instruction">Usage</h4>
            <p class="section-text">After the image is built, run the container with the output folder on the build system attached to <i>/output</i> in the container. I usually run these containers with the --rm flag so i dont have to worry about disposing them after exiting. Most of the time I use a different container for every single build on the basis that i need a clean environment.</p>
            <div class="code">cd /home/kvoid
docker run --rm -it -v ./output:/output toolchain</div>
            <p class="section-text">Obviously if you are willing to remove every residual left by previous builds then you can technically build everything in one container. But i like to keep my peace of mind so i'll just start a new one for every program i build.</p>
